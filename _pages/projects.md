### Characterizing Air Quality in Philadelphia
In this exploratory data analysis project, I studied the environmental (Air quality, Humidity, Noise Level and Temperature) conditions in the city of Philadelphia. For the analysis I scraped most of the data from the publicly available <a href="http://aircasting.habitatmap.org/mobile_map#?map_crowd=%22undefined%22&map=%7B%22zoom%22:5,%22lat%22:37.09024,%22lng%22:-95.712891,%22mapType%22:%22roadmap%22,%22hasChangedProgrammatically%22:false%7D&data=%7B%22sensorId%22:%22Particulate%20Matter-airbeam2-pm2.5%20(µg%2Fm³)%22,%22location%22:%22%22,%22tags%22:%22%22,%22usernames%22:%22%22,%22timeFrom%22:%221575936000%22,%22timeTo%22:%221607644799%22,%22heat%22:%7B%22lowest%22:0,%22low%22:12,%22mid%22:35,%22high%22:55,%22highest%22:150%7D,%22gridResolution%22:31,%22crowdMap%22:false%7D&fetchedSessionsCount=100" style="text-decoration: none;">AirCasting</a> database, collected some of my own using <a href="https://www.habitatmap.org/airbeamand" style="text-decoration: none;">AirBeam</a> sensors and leveraged Python's superior data munging and R's amazing visualization capabilities.

### Will Kobe make this shot?
In this fun application of Machine Learning we used a publicly available dataset that contains all of Kobe Bryant’s 30,697 shots that he attempted over the course of his NBA career to answer two questions:
1. Can we predict the outcome of Kobe’s shot with reasonable accuracy?
2. What are the important parameters in determining the outcome of Kobe’s shot?
