I am a Data Scientist (Research) in the Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics
at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute. My research at CHOP leverages
my background in machine learning, statistics and mathematical modeling to improve health outcomes in children.
Specifically, I work on the application and development of machine learning methods to address the
very many challenges in precision medicine, clinical decision support, and population health.

During my time at CHOP, I have actively collaborated with physicians and other domain experts on
the development of project plans, execution and dissemination of numerous machine learning research
projects.

<!-- Currently I am spending most of my time thinking about high frequency time series data and making
machine learning more interpretable.

In my spare time I enjoy indulging in one of my many hobbies that include playing the piano, golf,
travel, photography and scuba diving. Check out my blog to learn more! -->
