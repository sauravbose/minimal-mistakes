  I am a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://foursquare.com/" style="text-decoration: none;">Foursquare</a>,
where I work on using Machine Learning and Software Engineering tools in the Big Data realm to understand how people
move through the real world.

  Previously, I was a Data Scientist at the <a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute</a>
(colloquially referred to as  CHOP), where I worked cross-functionally with clinicians, radiologists, scientists
and engineers to improve health outcomes in children. During my time at CHOP, I led multiple NIH funded efforts
on the application and development of machine learning methods to address the very many challenges in precision
medicine, clinical decision support, and population health. I worked with structured and unstructured (images) data
modalities, and developed both classical machine learning and deep learning solutions for classification,
regression, semantic segmentation, object localization, landmark detection and recommendation tasks.

<!-- Currently I am spending most of my time thinking about high frequency time series data and making
machine learning more interpretable.

In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano, golf,
travel, photography and scuba diving. Check out my blog to learn more! -->
