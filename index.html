I am a Data Scientist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute. I work
cross-functionally with clinicians, radiologists, scientists and engineers to improve health outcomes in children.
I have led multiple NIH funded efforts on the application and development of machine learning methods to
address the very many challenges in precision medicine, clinical decision support, and population health. I
have worked with structured and unstructured (images) data modalities, and developed both classical machine
learning and deep learning solutions for classification, regression, semantic segmentation,
object localization, landmark detection and recommendation tasks.

<!-- Currently I am spending most of my time thinking about high frequency time series data and making
machine learning more interpretable.

In my spare time I enjoy indulging in one of my many hobbies that include playing the piano, golf,
travel, photography and scuba diving. Check out my blog to learn more! -->
